# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment — Summary Report

## Methodology
Trader transaction data was merged with a Fear & Greed Index on a daily basis. Days were
classified into Fear and Greed. Performance metrics such as PnL and win rate were compared
across sentiment regimes. Traders were segmented based on leverage usage, trade frequency,
and consistency of profits.

## Key Insights
1. Performance differs by sentiment.
   Average PnL and win rate are lower on Fear days, while Greed days show higher
   profitability and lower drawdowns.

2. Behavior changes with sentiment.
   Traders increase leverage and trade frequency during Fear days, indicating panic
   or emotional trading behavior.

3. Segment differences.
   High leverage and frequent traders perform poorly during Fear days, while low
   leverage and consistent traders remain profitable across both regimes.

## Strategy Recommendations
1. Fear-Day Risk Rule:
   Reduce leverage and number of trades during Fear days, especially for high-risk
   traders.

2. Greed-Day Opportunity Rule:
   Increase trade frequency slightly with controlled leverage and long bias during
   Greed days.

## Conclusion
Market sentiment strongly influences trading behavior and performance. Emotion-driven
decisions during Fear periods increase risk, while disciplined strategies during Greed
periods lead to better outcomes.
